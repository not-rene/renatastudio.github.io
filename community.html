        <h1>Coming soon!</h1>
        <p> We're working on multiple new community platforms! We're gonna need some time to 
            get some content out there, but soon enough, we'll have some content. We'll
            be making a youtube channel and a tiktok page where we can post updates,
            sneak peeks, and more! If you want us to join a specific platform, you can let us know 
            on our discord server! Stay tuned!
